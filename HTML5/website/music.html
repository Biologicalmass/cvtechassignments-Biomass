            <td>A fun band that has made many funny and silly songs over the years. Long ago they even made their own TV show called the Aquabats,nowadays their show is on YouTube as the station in charge of their show went under.</td>
            <td>A rock band that picked up steam with their song Tick-Tick-Boom and have been on a rise every since. With a musical similarity to Queen and ACDC the hives became quite the sensation.</td>
